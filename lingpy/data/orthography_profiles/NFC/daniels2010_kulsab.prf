b	 b
d	 d
e	 e
ɸ	 ɸ
g	 g	 (this is also used in the digraph <gw> which is of questionable phonemic status)
gw	 gʷ
i	 i
i̵	 i	 (this is an allophone of /i/)
k	 k	 (this is also used in the digraph <kw>)
kw	 kʷ
l	 r	 (this is an allophone of /r/)
m	 m
n	 n
ŋ	 ŋ
o	 o
p	 p
r	 r
s	 s
β	 b	 (I don't know about this. I eventually settled on this being either an allophone of /b/ or present only in borrowings and therefore irrelevant for my study. You may want to keep it or you may want to subsume it under /b/.)
