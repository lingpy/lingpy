    Compute DBSCAN cluster analysis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    threshold : float
        The threshold for clustering you want to use.
    matrix : list
        The two-dimensional matrix passed as list or array.
    taxa : list
        The list of taxon names. If set to "False" a fake list of taxon names
        will be created, giving a positive numerical ID in increasing order for
        each column in the matrix.
    revert : bool
        If set to "False", don't return taxon names but simply the language
        identifiers and their labels as a dictionary. Otherwise returns a
        dictionary with labels as keys and list of taxon names as values.
    min_samples : int (default=1)
        The minimal samples parameter of the DBCSCAN method from the SKLEARN
        package.

    Returns
    -------
    clusters : dict
        Either a dictionary of taxon identifiers and labels, or a dictionary of
        labels and taxon names.

    Notes
    -----
    This method does not work as expected, probably since it normally requires
    distances between points as input. We list it only for completeness here,
    but urge to be careful when using the code and checking properly our
    implementation in the source code.

    Requires the scikitlearn package, downloadable from http://scikit-learn.org/.
